# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Minor link update. Major overhaul incoming.

## Goals
To create a minimalist portfolio site. 

## Design Goals
-Mobile-first
-Content-second
-Aesthetic-last

The idea being that if it is a site that functions on as many screens as possible, and the content displays, then changes to the aesthetic should be simple, non-disruptive of flow, and do not distract from the content.
